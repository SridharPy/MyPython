from tkinter import * #this import everythinga nd we down have to use tkinter.object name
#instead we can use the object name alone.

window = Tk() #Creates the window


window.mainloop() # All code has to be between window and mainloop() else window will flash and go away
#this window.mainloop() keeps the window open and only closes on clicking x
