pip install pyinstaller

Once Done. type pyinstaller main_scriptname.py

For desktop APP the main script is FrontBookApp.py as it imports BackBookApp.py so

pyinstaller FrontBookApp.py

But this will create a lot more files which is good for troubleshooting but for a single exe type below --onefile --windowed without windowed the file will open a command prompt in background

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed FrontBookApp.py
